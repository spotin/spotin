        <b>SpotIn</b> is a place for <b>registering</b> spots. Spots can take place in the
        <b>virtual</b> or in the <b>physical</b> world. They capture the context and the circumstances that form the
        setting for an event. Each spot receives a <b>stable Uniform Resource Identifier (URI)</b> that can be
        used for <b>referencing</b> purposes. Spots can contain arbitrary <b>metadata</b> describing a context and
        circumstances. Additionally, spots can <b>redirect</b> the user to the original source of information.
        Once created, spots are searchable by places and by keywords.
